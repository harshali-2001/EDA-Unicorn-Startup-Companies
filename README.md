# Unicorn Startup Companies Project

## Description

This Python project aims to simulate a dataset of startup companies and perform various operations on the data. The project is designed to demonstrate basic data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques using Python.

## Features

- Generate random data for startup companies including name, industry, valuation, funding rounds, etc.
- Perform basic operations on the dataset, such as filtering, sorting, and aggregation.
- Visualize key metrics using charts and graphs.
- Identify unicorn startups (companies with valuations over $1 billion).

## Files

- `unicorn_startup.py`: Main Python script containing the code for generating and analyzing the startup data.
- `startup_data.csv`: Example dataset generated by the script for demonstration purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run `unicorn_startup.py` to generate and analyze the startup data.

## Usage

- `unicorn_startup.py` contains the main code. Run this script to generate random startup data and perform analyses.
- The script will output the results and generate a CSV file (`startup_data.csv`) with the generated data.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `random`: for generating random data.
- `pandas`: for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: for data visualization.

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
